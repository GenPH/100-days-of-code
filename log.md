# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Week 1: HTML/CSS and organizing.
### Day 1: May 6, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created a new FreeCodeCamp account and completed HTML and CSS exercises, started daily Enki exercises in HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts** It's been a while since I've last coded. Enki changed since the last time I've used it, can't say that it was for the best.
